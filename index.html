      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by my first CodePen! I'm a future web developer who is currently working as a Print and Motion Graphics Artist. </p>
      <p>The inner workings of the web have always interested me, and it wasn't until recently that I really wanted to put on my scuba suit, and dive deep into programming. Once I found Thinkful, I knew that I was on my way to becomming a web artist and developer.</p>
      <p>I really enjoy helping people, it's in my blood and what I am most passionate about. So you might find me hopping around the chatroom dishing out as much helpful advice as I can! And if I don't know the answer right away, chances are I'll look it up myself!</p>

    <section class="location">
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Currently I'm located in the great Chicago, IL! As you can probably tell from my cover-photo, I don't plan on staying here long. My ultimate goal is to move westward (San Fransisco being the ideal location).</p>
      <p>In 2013, I graduated from the prestigious Illinois State University with a B.S. in Arts Technology. Arts Technology encompasses all fine arts and how technology could enhance them. This is where I started my journey into becomming a programmer.</p>
